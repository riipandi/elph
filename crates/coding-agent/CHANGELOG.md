## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ui.density` setting (default `compact`): collapsed tool-call items pack together in the
  transcript log (grouped/narrow log lines). Expanded (accessed) tool-call items, `Thinking`,
  and AI chat response/assistant items always keep line breaks above and below. Set to `loose`
  for the classic blank-line spacing between every process-log row. The former boolean
  `ui.narrowLogLines` is migrated automatically (`true` → `compact`, `false` → `loose`).
